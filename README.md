# Python Module 0 – 42

## Description  
Python Module 0 is an introductory project from 42 focused on learning the fundamentals of Python programming through small, practical exercises inspired by a community garden theme. The project introduces core Python concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, recursion, input/output handling, and basic data types, encouraging clean code and logical thinking from the very beginning.

## Skills Developed  
Python syntax and fundamentals, functions and return values, input and output handling, conditional logic, loops (while and for), basic recursion, string manipulation, code structure, readability, and problem-solving.

## 📘 Exercises Overview  
ex0 prints a welcome message for the garden community.  
ex1 calculates the area of a garden plot.  
ex2 sums the total harvest amount using user input.  
ex3 determines if a plant is ready based on its age.  
ex4 checks whether plants need watering.  
ex5 counts days until harvest using both iterative and recursive approaches.  
ex6 displays a formatted summary of garden information.  
ex7 manages a seed inventory with type hints and controlled output formatting.

## ⚙️ How to Run  
Move into the exercise directory and run the file with Python 3:

```bash
python3 ft_file_name.py
```

##`⚠️ Important`  
To be able to execute the file directly from the console, remember to call the function at the end of the file, for example:

ft_example_run()

Without this function call, running the file will not produce any output.

## 🎯 Goal  
The goal of this module is to build a solid foundation in Python and prepare students for more advanced programming concepts and future projects at 42.
